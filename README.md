# 0e.vc â€“ a shared short domain

I bought this short domain, when I wanted to win an XSS challenge
(I didn't).

Given that short domains are rare and I use this rather seldomly,
I'm accepting pull requests to add to the existing functionality.

# Contributing

I'm accepting  pull requests that add new or interesting XSS-like attacks.

**I will not accept pull requests that turn this into a redirect
for your website or a generic tiny url service.**
